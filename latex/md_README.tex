The {\bfseries Stan Math Library} is a C++, reverse-\/mode automatic differentiation library designed to be usable, extensive and extensible, efficient, scalable, stable, portable, and redistributable in order to facilitate the construction and utilization of algorithms that utilize derivatives.

\subsection*{Licensing }

The Stan Math Library is licensed under the \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stan-dev/math/develop/licenses/stan-math-library-license.txt}{\tt new B\+S\+D license}.

\subsection*{Required Libraries }

Stan Math depends on two libraries\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Boost (version 1.\+58)\+: \href{http://www.boost.org}{\tt Boost Home Page}
\item Eigen (version 3.\+24)\+: \href{http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page}{\tt Eigen Home Page}
\end{DoxyItemize}

These are distributed under the {\ttfamily lib/} subdirectory. Only these two versions of the dependent libraries have been tested with Stan Math.

\subsection*{Installation }

The Stan Math Library is a header-\/only C++ library.

A simple hello world program using Stan Math is as follows\+:

``` \#include $<$stan/math.\+hpp$>$ \#include $<$iostream$>$

int main() \{ std\+::cout $<$$<$ \char`\"{}log normal(1 $\vert$ 2, 3)=\char`\"{} $<$$<$ stan\+::math\+::normal\+\_\+log(1, 2, 3) $<$$<$ std\+::endl; \} ```

If this is in the file {\ttfamily /path/to/foo/foo.cpp}, then you can compile and run this with something like this, with the {\ttfamily path/to} business replaced with actual paths\+:

``` \begin{quote}
cd /path/to/foo clang++ -\/\+I /path/to/stan-\/math -\/\+I /path/to/\+Eigen -\/\+I /path/to/boost foo.\+cpp ./a.out \end{quote}
log normal(1 $\vert$ 2, 3)=-\/2.\+07311 ```

The {\ttfamily -\/\+I} includes provide paths pointing to the three necessary includes\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Stan Math Library\+: path to source directory that contains {\ttfamily stan} as a subdirectory
\item Eigen C++ Matrix Library\+: path to source directory that contains {\ttfamily Eigen} as a subdirectory
\item Boost C++ Library\+: path to source directory that contains {\ttfamily boost} as a subdirectory
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note that the paths should {\itshape not} include the final directories {\ttfamily stan}, {\ttfamily Eigen}, or {\ttfamily boost} on the paths. An example of a real instantiation\+:

``` clang++ -\/\+I $\sim$/stan-\/dev/math -\/\+I $\sim$/stan-\/dev/math/lib/eigen\+\_\+3.2.\+4/ -\/\+I $\sim$/stan-\/dev/math/lib/boost\+\_\+1.58.\+0/ foo.\+cpp ```

The following directories all exist below the links given to {\ttfamily -\/\+I}\+: {\ttfamily $\sim$/stan-\/dev/math/stan} and {\ttfamily $\sim$/stan-\/dev/math/lib/eigen\+\_\+3.2.\+4/\+Eigen} and {\ttfamily $\sim$stan-\/dev/math/lib/boost\+\_\+1.58.\+0/boost}.

\subsection*{Other Compilers }

There\textquotesingle{}s nothing special about {\ttfamily clang++} --- the {\ttfamily g++} compiler behaves the same way. You\textquotesingle{}ll need to modify the commands for other compilers, which will need to be up-\/to-\/date enough to compile the Stan Math Library.
